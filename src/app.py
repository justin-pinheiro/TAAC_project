class app:
    """
    A class for running a simple Streamlit web application that takes a video as input from the user,
    processes the video to extract highlights second by second using a trained model, and displays
    the predictions along with confidence scores.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    model : Model
        The trained model used for video highlight prediction.
    feature_extractor : FeatureExtraction
        The feature extractor used to extract features from the input video.
    video_file : str
        Path to the uploaded video file.
    fps : int
        Frames per second used to extract features from the video.
    output_dir : str
        Directory where video highlights will be stored.
    batch_size : int
        Number of samples processed per batch.
    confidence_threshold : float
        The threshold for the prediction confidence to consider a highlight.
    display_video : bool
        Flag to determine if video highlights should be displayed in the web app.
    verbose : bool
        Flag to enable or disable detailed command line output.

    Methods:
    -------
    __init__(model, feature_extractor, fps=2, batch_size=32, confidence_threshold=0.5, display_video=True, verbose=False):
        Initializes the app with the model, feature extractor, evaluator, and other parameters.

    run_app():
        Runs the Streamlit web app, allowing the user to upload a video and receive highlights.

    upload_video():
        Allows the user to upload a video file through the Streamlit interface.

    extract_features(video_file):
        Extracts features from the uploaded video using the feature extractor.

    make_predictions(features):
        Uses the trained model to make predictions on the extracted features.

    filter_highlights(predictions, confidence_threshold):
        Filters the predictions based on a confidence threshold to identify significant highlights.

    display_highlights(video_file, predictions, confidence_threshold):
        Displays the video highlights and corresponding predictions in the web app.

    render_video_highlight(video_file, prediction, start_time, end_time):
        Renders and displays a small video extract of the highlight event, based on the prediction.

    output_predictions(predictions, verbose):
        Outputs the prediction confidence for analysis in the command line, if verbose is enabled.

    save_highlight_video(highlights, output_dir):
        Saves the video extracts of the highlights in the specified output directory.

    display_confidence(predictions):
        Displays the confidence scores of the predictions for each event in the web app.

    update_ui(predictions, highlights):
        Updates the Streamlit UI to show the video highlights and predictions in real-time.

    process_video(video_file):
        Processes the uploaded video, extracts features, makes predictions, and filters highlights.

    save_results(predictions, highlights, output_dir):
        Saves the final prediction results and video highlights to the specified output directory.
