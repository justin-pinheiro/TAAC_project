class DataLoading:
    """
    A class for loading features and labels for videos, creating a PyTorch Dataset, 
    and preparing DataLoaders for model training and evaluation.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    features_path : str
        Path to the directory containing extracted features.
    labels_path : str
        Path to the directory containing labels corresponding to each video.
    batch_size : int
        Batch size for the DataLoader.
    shuffle : bool
        Whether to shuffle the dataset during loading (default: True).

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(features_path, labels_path, batch_size, shuffle=True):
        Initializes the class with paths, batch size, shuffle.

    load_features_labels(video_name):
        Loads features and labels for a given video from the respective directories.

    preprocess_features(features):
        Preprocesses features to ensure compatibility with the model (e.g., normalization, padding).

    preprocess_labels(labels):
        Preprocesses labels to match the model's requirements (e.g., one-hot encoding).

    create_dataset():
        Combines features and labels for all videos into a PyTorch Dataset.

    split_dataset():
        Splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

    create_dataloader(dataset, batch_size, shuffle):
        Creates a PyTorch DataLoader for a given dataset.

    get_dataloader(type):
        Returns DataLoader for training, validation, and test sets based on the required set.
